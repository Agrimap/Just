#  Install

Here are some ways to leverage Just.

-   **Source File**: There's only one. Drop it in a playground or, if so desired, directly into
    your code base.

-   **Git Submodule**: Add this repository as a git submodule, drop `Just.xcodeproj` in to your
    Xcode project so that you can make `Just.framework` a dependency and link to it.

-   **Dynamic Framework**: [Carthage][] can install Just because Just is a dynamic framework
    for iOS and OS X. Other ways to use 3rd party dynamic framework should also work.
