## Install

Just is a relatively simple project. You can use it in the following ways.

### Source File

There's only one. Drop it in a playgronud or, if so desired, directly into
your code base.

### Git Submodule

Add this repository as a git submodule, drop `Just.xcodeproj` in to your Xcode
project so that you can make `Just.framework` a dependency and link to it.

### Dynamic Framework

[Carthage][] can install Just because Just is a dynamic framework for iOS and
OS X, therefore other ways to use 3rd party dynamic framework also works.
