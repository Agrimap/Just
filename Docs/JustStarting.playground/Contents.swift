//: # Just: HTTP for Humans
//: This document is an introduction to the basics of donig HTTP via Just.
//: Readers are assumed to understand of the HTTP protocal.
//:
//: Just's API is heavily influenced by [python-requests](http://python-requests.org),
//: a popular client-side HTTP library in the Python community.
//:
//: Here's a simple POST request via Just:

    Just.post("http://httpbin.org/post")

//: A GET request with some URL query parameters is as simple as:

    Just.get("http://httpbin.org/get", params:["page": 3])

//: As you will find out throughout this tutorial, with Just, making network
//: requests takes minimal amount of effort.

//: ## Synchronous v. Asynchronous
//: When working with Swift, we tend to shun sychronous network requests because
//: they block when invoked on the main thread, which would prevent our
//: Cocoa/Cocoa Touch apps from smooth UI rendering. However, there's nothing
//: inherantly wrong with synchronous requests. In fact, synchronous code is often
//: easier to understand and, therefore, a better paradigm to explore HTTP
//: resources with. In REPL or playgrounds, you can see the result of
//: synchronous results.

    var r = Just.get("http://httpbin.org/get", params:["page": 3])
    // â€¦ "r" becomes available here

//: However, Just doesn't force you to choose. The same request can be made
//: asynchronusly like this

    Just.get("http://httpbin.org/get", params:["page": 3]) { (r) in
        // the same "r" is available asynchronouly here
    }

//: That is, you can switch between the two paradigm by adding/removing a
//: callback. When such callback is present, the result of the request becomes
//: available asynchronously as an arugment to the callback. Otherwise,
//: Just will return the very same result synchronouly.
//:
//: The examples in the rest of this document will be synchronous. Keep in
//: mind that all of them can easily become asynchronous.

//: ## HTTP Result
//: The result of a HTTP request is captured in a single object.
//: Let's take a look at `r` from the previous example.

    // is the request successful?
    r.ok
    r.statusCode
    r.error

//: Hopefully, that's self explainatory. `ok` is `true` if a respose is
//: received and the `statusCode` is not `4xx` or `5xx`. When `ok` is `false`,
//: `error` may contain an `NSError` object from the underlying `NSURLSession`.
//:
//: Moving on:

    // what did the server return?
    r.headers   // response headers
    r.content   // response body as NSData?
    r.text      // response body as text?
    r.json      // response body parsed by NSJSONSerielization
    r.url       // the URL, as `NSURL`

//: The `headers` property is a Swift-dictionary-like object:

    for (k,v) in r.headers {
        println("\(k):\(v)")
    }

//: It's different from a normal dictionary in that its values can be accessed
//: by case-insensitive keys:

    r.headers["Content-Length"]
    r.headers["cOnTeNt-LeNgTh"]

//: The original request is preserved as a `NSURLRequest`:

    r.request
    r.request?.HTTPMethod

//: ## More Complicated Requests

//: To send form values, use the `data` parameter:

    // body of this request will be `firstName=Barry&lastName=Allen`
    // a `Content-Type` header will be added as `application/x-form-www-encoded`
    Just.post("http://httpbin.org/post", data:["firstName":"Barry","lastName":"Allen"])

//: JSON values are similar:

    // body of this request will be in JSON
    // a `Content-Type` header will be added as `application/json`
    Just.post("http://httpbin.org/post", json:["firstName":"Barry","lastName":"Allen"])

//: By default, Just follows server's redirect instrution. You can supply a
//: `allowRedirects` argument to control this behavior.

    // redirects
    Just.get("http://httpbin.org/redirect/2").url

    // no redirects
    Just.get("http://httpbin.org/redirect/2", allowRedirects:false).url

//: ## Files
//: Uploading files is easy with Just:

    import Foundation
    if let photoPath = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource("elon", ofType:"jpg"), let photoURL = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: photoPath) {
        if let text = Just.post("http://httpbin.org/post", files:["elon":.URL(photoURL, nil)]).text {
            print(text)
        }
    }

//: Here a file is specified with an NSURL. Alternatively, a file can be a NSData or just a string. Although in both cases, a file is needed.

    if let someData = "Marco".dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding) {
        if let text = Just.post("http://httpbin.org/post", files:["a":.Data("marco.text", someData, nil), "b":.Text("polo.txt", "Polo", nil)]).text {
            print(text)
        }
    }

//: Two files are being uploaded here.
//:
//: The `nil` part of the argument in both examples is an optional String that can be used to specify the MIMEType of the files.
//:
//: `data` parametor can be used in conjuction with `files`. When that happens, though, the `Content-Type` of the request will be `multipart/form-data; ...`.

    if let photoPath = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource("elon", ofType:"jpg"), let photoURL = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: photoPath) {
        if let json = Just.post("http://httpbin.org/post", data:["lastName":"Musk"], files:["elon":.URL(photoURL, nil)]).json as? [String:AnyObject] {
            print(json["form"])
            print(json["files"])
        }
    }

//: ## Cookies
//:
//: If you expect the server to return some cookie, you can find them this way:

    Just.get("http://httpbin.org/cookies/set/name/elon", allowRedirects:false).cookies["name"] // returns an NSHTTPCookie

//: To send requests with cookies:

    Just.get("http://httpbin.org/cookies", cookies:["test":"just"])

//: ## Authentication
//:
//: If a request is to be challenged by basic or digest authentication, an `auth` parameter can be used to provide a tuple for username and password

    Just.get("http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/flash/allen", auth:("flash", "allen"))
